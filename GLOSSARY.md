# bits
A *bit* is the smallest unit of data in computers - it can have only one of two
possible values - on or off, true or false, 1 or 0, etc. Another word for it 
is *binary digit*.

# byte
A set of 8 bits makes a byte.

# DHCP
Stands for *dynamic host configuration protocol*. A set of standards and computer 
services which is used to configure computers and servers when they start up. 
DHCP is mostly used to provide an address to a computer when it is connecting 
to the network, without it, users or administrators would have to manually given 
an address to each computer.

# DMZ
Stands for *demilitarized-zone*. A portion of a computer network which sits 
between a secure/trusted and insecure/untrusted network – for example, between 
an internal corporate network and the Internet. An email server is an example 
of a server which would be connected to the DMZ network such that it can be 
reached from inside the corporate network as well as receive and send emails 
with the rest of the Internet. Typically, a firewall protects the inside network 
from the DMZ and another firewall protects the DMZ from the Internet.

# DNS
Stands for *domain name system*. A computer system which makes it possible to 
access computers and servers using friendly names instead of network address. 
For example, `google.com` instead of `74.125.196.139`.

# micrometre
The micrometre is also known as micron. It is one millionth of a meter, or 
0.001 mm - about 0.000039 inch.

# NTP
Stands for *network time protocol*. A set of standards and computer services 
which are used to synchronize the clock of computers against reliable clocks. 
Without this, computers wouldn’t be able to maintain an accurate time as they 
would drift over time, just like most watches do.

# redundancy
In engineering, redundancy is the duplication of critical components or 
functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the 
system, usually in the form of a backup or fail-safe.

# resiliency
The capacity to recover quickly from difficulties, the ability to avoid or 
reduce the impact of problems to avoid complete failure. A system is resilient 
if it is still usable when some of its parts are not working. 

# UPS
Stands for *uninterruptible power supply*. A device which has batteries and 
regulates the power, preventing computers to stop during a power outage or power 
fluctuations.
