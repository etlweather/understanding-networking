Understanding Networking for the non-IT
==============================================

Networking is ubiquitous to today's world - it's part of your phone, your
computer, your tablet, your water meter, your thermostat...

However, networking can be complex to actually understand. People in an 
administrative position can be at the mercy of the network. Therefore it is
important that they understand what it is and how it works.

This small book aims at providing a rapid, but complete, understanding of 
the various concepts of networking, the components and equipment.

There are various types of network but this book will only cover the kind most
encountered in today's day-to-day activities and businesses.

Finally, the data in this book could seem innacurate to an advanced networking
engineer who already understands all the concepts. The purpose of this book is
to teach the non-IT personnel to a level where they understand what is happening,
not train them to replace the engineer.
