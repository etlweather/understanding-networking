Wireless networking
====================================

While wireless data transmission technologies have existed for more than 100 
year[^1], its use in computer networking is becoming more and more popular.

Long distance links are now routinely set up in areas where installing fiber 
optic cables is prohibitive or not possible, laptops are now always equipped 
with a wireless network card, phones and other so-called smart devices are 
connected to the Internet via wireless network connections.

A wireless network used to connect user devices is normally called a 
*wireless local area network* (WLAN).

## Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is the name of a popular wireless networking technology (as defined in
the IEEE 802.11 standards). The word Wi-Fi is actually a trademark owned by the
Wi-Fi Alliance (an organization which was formed to hold the trademark). The 
term was coined for marketting as a play on words with *hi-fi*, however, it is
not short "wireless fidelity".

Wi-Fi only represents the technology used. While commonly associated with 
wireless Internet access, a Wi-Fi device simply provides a way to connect to a
computer network wirelessly. What is on the computer network isn't regulated by
the Wi-Fi standards.

## SSID
SSID is short for Service Set IDentifier. An SSID is a network name in a 
wireless network. It is what is used to identify the different wireless networks 
that exist.
