The basic terms
====================================

Before delving into how a network works, let's define some of the key term with
basic definition to help comprehension.

## networking
In computing, networking is the practice of connecting devices (computers)
together for the exchange of data.

A computer network is made of *networking devices* (switches, routers, etc)
and *nodes* (computers, printers, phones, etc).

> network.[^1]

## switch
A device through which computers connect to the network. Switches are also 
inter-connected with other switches to extend the network to other physical 
areas. A switch has basic *intelligence*. When a data unit is transmitted 
through it, the switch reads the begining of the data unit to see where it 
goes and passes the data unit only to the recipient.

## hub
A hub is basically like a switch, except it has no *intelligence*. All data unit
received are passed on to all devices connected to it, regardless of destination.
Nowaday, hubs are rarely used.

## port
A port is a connector on a network device where a cable can be connected.

## patch panel 
A patch basically mean to connect two things together. A patch panel is a where
the cables coming from the wall outlets through the walls, are connected. The
cables are attached to the back of a connector attached to the patch panel. The
front is a standard network cable connector which is used to connect a cable
between the patch panel and the switch port (or other device).

## patch cable
A (normally) short cable used to connect two devices together or to connect a 
device to a patch panel or wall outlet. Patch cables are normally made of a 
different type of wire (stranded - multiple small strand of coper wires) than 
the cables that run through the walls (solid - a single and thicker strand of 
coper wire). Due to its material, there is more signal loss on a patch cable,
in favor of its flexibility. For this reason, it is best to keep patch cable
relatively short.

## protocol
In computing, protocols are sets of rules or standards for transmitting 
information - be it networking or transmitting data between two components of 
a computer. For exapmle, a networking protocol would dictate how two devices
discover each other, how they establish a communication channel and how they
signify the end of a transmission.

## ethernet
Ethernet is a set of technologies, protocols and standards for networking. There
are other networking technologies, but Ethernet today is the most common. The 
key aspect of Ethernet is that multiple devices can be connected through a
switch or hub to form a network and thus able to exchange information.

## modem
*MOdulator DEModulator* - a device which encodes dinary data (digital) into an 
analog signal suitable to be transmitted between devices. For example, modems
were used to connect computers via phone lines. Modems are still used today - 
for example, to connect mobile computers (such as smartphones) to computer 
networks via cellular signal.

## router
A router connects one network to another. This is an advanced networking concept. 
Computers on a network are able to communicate with each other through switches, 
however, they arenâ€™t able to connect to another network without a router. For 
example, multiple computers in a house are inter-connected with a switch. A 
router is then used to connect the switch to the Internet. The computers then 
can communicate with other computers on the Internet by going through the router 
as the router knows how to route the data over the Internet.

## IP address
IP stands for *Internet Protocol* - it is a protocol (set of standards) which
defines a way for computers to communicate over a network and how data is 
exchanged between computer networks.

An IP address then is simply the identifier (address) of a computer in an 
IP-based network. In the human form, it is made of 4 sets of 1 to 3 digits (to
the computer, this is all 0s or 1s), for example, `192.168.1.1`.

## firewall
A network device that is installed between two networks and provide security 
features by inspecting the data sent from one network to the other and allows or 
denies the traffic based on a set of rules configured by the administrator. It 
is similar to a router but performs more security functions by inspecting the 
traffic, not only routing it. It is typically used between the Internet and a 
corporate network to prevent malicious intrusions from the Internet onto the 
internal network.

## host
Another word for a computer or server, generally referring to a physical machine.

## fiber optic
A type of cable made of glass through which light is transmitted. Computer data 
is converted into light signals which go through the fiber optic cables. This 
method of transmitting computer data can be used over long distance at 
ultra-fast speed (speed of light).

A typical fiber optic cable is made of multiple layers - two layers carrying
the light signal (a core and a surrounding layer which confines the light to 
the core), and two layers of protection. In total, the size of a typical fiber 
optic cable (also called *strand*) is 780 micrometre (or 0.03042 inch).

> The concept for transmitting light in such a way was first publicly 
> demonstrated using a water flow carrying light in 1870.[^2]

## packet
A packet is a unit of information sent through the network. It contains various
parts such as the source, destination and the data. If a file, for example, is
copied from one computer to another via the network, it will be broken up into
multiple packets which will be sent through the network.

## bandwidth
The bandwidth of a network link is how much data can travel on it in one second
(*bps*). It is calculated in terms of bits per second. It can be said to be the 
maximum speed of a network - its capacity. With no other factors involved, if a 
network has a 100 Mbps (*Mega-bits per second*) bandwidth, it means that a movie
of 700MB (*Mega-bytes*) will take 56 seconds to be transmitted.

Speed is often used interchangeably with bandwidth. It is more correct to use 
speed to qualify a data transmission (a download, etc) and bandwidth for the
capacity of a line.

## latency
While the bandwdith represents how many bits per second can pass through the 
network, latency is how long it takes for a packet to be transmitted. Latency 
does affect the actual speed of a link - a long latency reduces the speed.

Today (2016), latency is measured in milliseconds (ms). On a local network, it 
is usually below 2ms. On the Internet, one commonly finds 100ms as an average.

## network
The word network can be used in multiple ways - it is often used to mean a 
*computer network* which is a system of inter-connected hosts, switches, routers, 
etc.

However, network engineers often use the term to refer to an abtract concept
relating to how hosts on a computer network are addressed. On a network, 
computers can communicate with each other through switches, but they can't 
communicate to computers which are connected to another network - a router is
needed to route the packets between networks.

A network, in that sense, is defined by the IP addresses. For example, a network
can be defined such that any IP address between `192.168.1.1` and `192.168.1.254`
can communicate directly, but to get to other addresses, such as `192.168.2.1`,
the devices need to send the traffic to a router (also know as gateway).

This matters in networking because this is how security constraints can be 
enforced. It also shows how two different corporate networks can be 
inter-connected and be able to exchange information. There are other benefits 
but they won't be covered here.
